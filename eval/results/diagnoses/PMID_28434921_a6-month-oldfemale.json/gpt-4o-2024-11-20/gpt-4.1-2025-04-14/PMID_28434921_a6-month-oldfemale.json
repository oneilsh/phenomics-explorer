[Laubry-Pezzi syndrome](https://monarchinitiative.org/MONDO:0020427): A rare congenital heart malformation involving ventricular septal defects and aortic valve prolapse, which aligns with the patient's **perimembranous ventricular septal defect** and potential progression to **pulmonary arterial hypertension**.\n2. [Congenital pulmonary lymphangiectasia](https://monarchinitiative.org/MONDO:0009933): A developmental disorder involving pulmonary lymphatic dilation, which can lead to **pulmonary arterial hypertension**.\n3. [Eisenmenger syndrome](https://monarchinitiative.org/MONDO:0019944): A form of pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with unoperated congenital heart defects, such as ventricular septal defects.\n4. [Congenital total pulmonary venous return anomaly](https://monarchinitiative.org/MONDO:0007130): A congenital defect that can lead to **pulmonary arterial hypertension** and other cardiac complications.\n5. [Lymphedema-cerebral arteriovenous anomaly syndrome](https://monarchinitiative.org/MONDO:0007917): A syndrome involving pulmonary hypertension and other vascular anomalies.\n6. [Yellow nail syndrome](https://monarchinitiative.org/MONDO:0007921): A rare disorder with pulmonary and lymphatic involvement, potentially leading to **pulmonary arterial hypertension**.\n7. [Cardiac septal defects with coarctation of the aorta](https://monarchinitiative.org/MONDO:0008912): A condition involving septal defects and potential progression to pulmonary complications.\n8. [Congenital Gerbode defect](https://monarchinitiative.org/MONDO:0020428): A rare congenital heart defect involving abnormal communication between the heart chambers, which may lead to pulmonary complications.\n9. [ALG8-congenital disorder of glycosylation](https://monarchinitiative.org/MONDO:0011969): A systemic disorder that can involve cardiac and pulmonary complications.\n10. [Short stature, facial dysmorphism, and skeletal anomalies with or without cardiac anomalies 1](https://monarchinitiative.org/MONDO:0100297): A syndrome that may include cardiac anomalies such as septal defects.\n\n### Next Steps\nThis list is based on the patient's features and excludes diseases associated with the excluded features.
