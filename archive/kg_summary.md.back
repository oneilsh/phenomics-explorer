## Node Labels and Properties

### Common Properties Across Node Types
- `name`: The common name of the entity.
- `description`: A detailed description of the entity.
- `id`: A unique identifier for the entity.
- `in_taxon_label`: The taxonomic association of the entity (when applicable).
- `synonym`: Alternative names or synonyms for the entity.
- `provided_by`: The source or database that provided the information.
- `category`: The ontological categories the entity belongs to.

### Specific Node Types and Their Properties

#### `biolink_Gene`
- Represents genes with information about symbols, synonyms, full names, cross-references, and taxonomic context.
- Additional Properties: `symbol`, `full_name`.

#### `biolink_Disease`
-  Represents diseases with information about synonyms, names, descriptions, and sources.

#### `biolink_ChemicalEntity`
-  Represents chemical entities with details about synonyms, names, descriptions, and sources.

#### `biolink_BiologicalProcess`
-  Represents biological processes with information about names, taxonomic context, and sources.

#### `biolink_Cell`
-  Represents cells with details about names, descriptions, and sources.

#### `biolink_PhenotypicFeature`
-  Represents phenotypic features with information about synonyms, names, descriptions, and sources.

#### `biolink_Pathway`
-  Represents pathways with information about names, taxonomic context, and sources.

#### `biolink_Drug`
-  Represents drugs with information about synonyms, names, descriptions, and sources.

#### `biolink_Publication`
-  Represents publications, including articles, patents, and web pages.

#### `biolink_EvidenceType`
-  Represents types of evidence used to support assertions.

## Relationship Types and Contexts

### Important Relationships
- `biolink_interacts_with`: Indicates interactions between entities such as genes or gene products.
- `biolink_expressed_in`: Indicates where a gene or gene product is expressed within an anatomical entity or cell type.
- `biolink_has_phenotype`: Connects genes, diseases, and other entity types to phenotypic features.
- `biolink_actively_involved_in`: Connects genes or gene products to biological processes or activities, indicating active involvement.
- `biolink_orthologous_to`: Connects genes or gene products that are orthologous.
- `biolink_enables`: Connects genes or gene products to biological processes or activities that they enable.
- `biolink_located_in`: Indicates the cellular or anatomical location of a gene or gene product.
- `biolink_subclass_of`: Transitive, hierarchical relationship used for classification, typically amongst entities of the same type.
- `biolink_participates_in`: Connects genes or gene products to biological pathways in which they participate.
- `biolink_gene_associated_with_condition`: Connects genes or gene products to diseases or phenotypic features. These should be considered independent of `biolink_causes` and `biolink_contributes_to`, as these do not necessarily imply "association" in the graph.
- `biolink_causes`: Indicates that a gene or gene product causes a disease or phenotypic feature.
- `biolink_contributes_to`: Indicates that a gene or gene product contributes to a disease or phenotypic feature.
- `biolink_enables`: Connects genes or gene products to biological processes or activities that they enable.
- `biolink_part_of`: Indicates that a gene or gene product is part of a biological process or activity.
- `biolink_related_to`: A general relationship that connects diseases to various biological entities such as phenotypic features, biological processes, or anatomical entities.

### Important Relationship Properties
- `has_evidence`: A property of relationships indicating the type of evidence supporting the relationship. Found in relationships such as `biolink_acts_upstream_of_or_within`, `biolink_actively_involved_in`, `biolink_enables`, `biolink_located_in`, `biolink_part_of`, and `biolink_orthologous_to`.
- `publications`: A property of relationships referring to publications that are associated with the relationship. Found in relationships such as `biolink_has_phenotype` and `biolink_has_mode_of_inheritance`.
- Qualifier properties: Provide additional context to relationships. Examples include `sex_qualifier`, `frequency_qualifier`, `onset_qualifier`, and `stage_qualifier`. Found in relationships such as `biolink_has_phenotype` and `biolink_expressed_in`.

## Redundancy and Frequency Analysis

- General labels such as `biolink_Entity` and `biolink_NamedThing` are very common and may be too general for most queries.
- Biological labels like `biolink_BiologicalEntity` and `biolink_PhysicalEssence` are also quite common but cover a wide range of biological concepts.
- Specific labels such as `biolink_Gene`, `biolink_Disease`, and `biolink_ChemicalEntity` are useful for targeted queries.
